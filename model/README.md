This is the model for rice visualization and simulation, combined with optimization algorithms. 
The model should run on the modelling platform GroIMP v 1.5 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/groimp/). 
In order to run the model, open the GroIMP platform, create a new RGG project, then add all rgg and java files to the project and save as a gsz (compressed) file.
